1). Use letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits,  underscores, and doller signs.
2). Start with letter, underscore, or doller sign (not a digit)
3). Avoid reserved keywords
4). Choose meaningful names reflecting the variables purpose.
5). Spaces are not allowed within variable names in JavaScript. Instead, you can use camel case (first letter lowercase, subsequent words capitalized) or underscores to separate words.
6). Avoid abbreviations for clarity
7). For constants value, use all uppercase letters with underscores.
